                <p>This web is derivation of my original web page <a href="mynotes.cz">mynotes.cz </a>where you could find much more things related also to games. Due to some restrictions I lost access to this pages from business neworks (site was described as site with game content) and I lost the main purpose of those pages, write notes and use it when are needed. </p>
<p>From that reason I decided to create new dedicated web pages that will be dedicated just to IT things and not other. Hopefully this will be enough for its primary purpose. Please don´t expect here logs detail articles about IT problematics. Instead i will post here useful things that can IT guy use on it´s daily job. </p>
